      <br>
      <p>Based on responses from more than 212,000 federal employees last year, Vandelay's workforce continues to
        score well and the agency is ranked third among large federal agencies as a best place to work.
        The rankings also reveal that Vandelay ranked second among all federal agencies in the categories of Effective
        Leadership, Teamwork and Support for Diversity, as well as other areas.</p>

      <h1>Work at Vandelay</h1>
      <br>
      <p>Since its inception in 1958, Vandelay has accomplished many great scientific and technological feats in air
        and space. Vandelay technology also has been adapted for many nonaerospace uses by the private sector.
        Vandelay remains a leading force in scientific research and in stimulating public interest in aerospace
        exploration, as well as science and technology in general.
        Perhaps more importantly, our exploration of space has taught us to view Earth, ourselves, and the universe in
        a new way. While the tremendous technical and scientific accomplishments of Vandelay demonstrate vividly that
        humans can achieve previously inconceivable feats, we also are humbled by the realization that Earth is just a
        tiny "blue marble" in the cosmos.</p>
